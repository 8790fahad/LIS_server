Remark section should include only
    1. Comment :  Reason for signing or rejecting the File
    2. Remark  :  File main status is of three type (Accepted, Treated, UnTreated)
        Remark status also are based on the active Tab e.g.:
        1. File Tab remarks: File NewFile, TreatedFile and UnTreatedFile (File as suffix)
        2. Recommendation Remarks: NewRecommendation,Treated Recommendation and UnTreatedRecommendation
        ....
        This resulted in 9 different Remarks.

    Finding:
    1. All file status should be store in DB to avoid hard codded style
        Table columns: Status and foward_to.

        Reason:
        1. A profer file status will clearly detarmine who is the reciver of the file
